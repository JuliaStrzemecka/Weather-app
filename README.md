In this project, I'm trying to create a simple weather app using HTML, APIs and Vanilla JS.
Enter a city name and instantly get the current weather conditions thanks to a live API! (OpenWeatherMap in this case) 

🛠️ To Do:
 [x] Add weather icons
 [ ] Display humidity and wind speed (maybe??)
 [x] Implement dark mode
