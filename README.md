In this project, I'm trying to create a simple weather app using HTML, APIs and Vanilla JS.
Enter a city name and instantly get the current weather conditions thanks to a live API! (OpenWeatherMap in this case) 

🛠️ To Do:
 ⬜ Add weather icons
 ⬜ Display humidity and wind speed (maybe??)
 ⬜ Implement dark mode
